A RESTful API, which stands for "Representational State Transfer" API, is a type of application programming interface (API) that follows specific design principles to enable applications to communicate with each other by treating data as resources accessed through standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, making it a flexible and widely used way to exchange information on the web.
